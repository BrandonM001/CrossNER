## CrossNER Dataset
- Labeled NER data for the five target domains (Politics, Science, Music, Literature, and AI) and the source domain (Reuters News from [CoNLL-2003 shared task](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0306050.pdf)) can be found in ner_data folder.
- Unlabeled domain-related corpora will be realsed soon.

## More details are coming soon!
